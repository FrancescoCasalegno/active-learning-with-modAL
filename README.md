# Active Learning Examples Using `modAL`

This repo contains the notebook [Active-Learning.ipynb](Active-Learning.ipynb)
where you can find different examples of using the
[`modAL`](https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package for
[Active Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning).

In particular, the notebook shows how Active Learning allows to achieve better
performance with fewer training samples. The difference is even more impressive
for more complex Machine Learning tasks, such as use cases involving highly
dimensional input spaces and multiclass classification problems.

# Installation

The code was tested with Python 3.9 on Mac OS X and Linux. To make sure you
have the right dependencies, please install the requirements as follows:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
